    <h2>Kyoto is the former capital city of Japan and world-famous for its refined culture, dining, and charm of rural Japan</h2>
    <p id="p"></p>
Kyoto City attracts millions of local and international visitors each year looking for traditional Japanese culture. <br> Temples and shrines such as Kiyomizudera Temple and Kinkakuji draw lots off attention from visitors, as do the bamboo groves of nearby Arashiyama. <br> Stay in a traditional ryokan, take a dip in a rejuvenating onsen, and enjoy the seasonal changes of cherry blossoms and brilliant autumn foliage. <br>Kyoto's magic is only a short bullet train ride from Tokyo. Beyond the city lie Kyoto Prefecture's many attractive rural areas.<br> In the north, Amanohashidate has long been considered one of Japan's three most scenic places. Nestled in the mountains, Miyama is one of the last towns with thatched-roof farmhouses, many of which are still inhabited. Enjoy delicious local vegetables and the famous green tea grown in Uji.

                <strong id="strong">Yudofu</strong> <br>
                Yudofu, literally "hot-water tofu", is arguably the best way to enjoy high-quality, freshly made tofu. Tofu is warmed through in a simple broth made of water and kombu, and simple condiments are served alongside.
                 Kyoto is the place to enjoy this, as it is the epicenter of Buddhist cuisine, in which yudofu features heavily.

                Kyo-gashi are a type of wagashi, or traditional Japanese sweet. Kyo-gashi are beautiful, 
                colorful and symbolic confections, custom-made for different occasions, so no Kyo-gashi 
                will ever be exactly the same as another.</td>

                Before modern transportation was available, farmers grew only the vegetables
                 most suited to the regions they farmed in. Kyo-yasai are vegetables traditionally grown in Kyoto for centuries, 
                 and they play an important role in modern Kyoto cuisine.</td>

                Green tea from Uji is among the oldest and most highly regarded teas in Japan.
                 You'll find it in tiny soba restaurants and temple gardens and many places in between. 
                 There are a variety of ways to enjoy green tea while in Uji.</td>

                Handmade ceramics and porcelain known as kyo yaki or Kiyomizu yaki are characterized by painted overglaze enamel. 
                This craft evolved alongside other sophisticated pastimes in Kyoto, including the tea ceremony and flower arranging.</td>

                <strong id="strong">Kyoto Dyed Silk</strong><br>
                Invented in the late 17th century, kyo yuzen is a dyeing technique distinguished by vivid colors, subtle gradations, complex patterns and precision linework.
                 The subtle use of stencils, brushes and resists produces designs on textiles similar to traditional Japanese paintings.</td>

                Nishijin ori silk textiles originate in Nishijin, the garment district of Kyoto.
                 Exquisitely decorated brocades have been handwoven here for centuries, and kimono and obi have been tailored from sumptuous gold brocade, damask, figured satin and velvet. Treated with care, these garments can last a lifetime.</td>

                Fashioned out of bamboo, the kyo sensu is a folding fan decorated with handmade Japanese paper or silk on thin wooden strips, traditionally cypress.
                 These artful accessories are used at ceremonies, festivals and performances such as Noh theater.</td>
