<h3 id="hkyoto">The old imperial capital and cultural heart of Japan</h3>
</section>
    <h2>Kyoto is the former capital city of Japan and world-famous for its refined culture, dining, and charm of rural Japan</h2>
    <p id="p"></p>
Kyoto City attracts millions of local and international visitors each year looking for traditional Japanese culture. <br> Temples and shrines such as Kiyomizudera Temple and Kinkakuji draw lots off attention from visitors, as do the bamboo groves of nearby Arashiyama. <br> Stay in a traditional ryokan, take a dip in a rejuvenating onsen, and enjoy the seasonal changes of cherry blossoms and brilliant autumn foliage. <br>Kyoto's magic is only a short bullet train ride from Tokyo. Beyond the city lie Kyoto Prefecture's many attractive rural areas.<br> In the north, Amanohashidate has long been considered one of Japan's three most scenic places. Nestled in the mountains, Miyama is one of the last towns with thatched-roof farmhouses, many of which are still inhabited. Enjoy delicious local vegetables and the famous green tea grown in Uji.
